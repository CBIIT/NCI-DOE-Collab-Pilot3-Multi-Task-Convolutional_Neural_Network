Data downloaded generated from GDC pathology reports.

Here is an example of a report on the GDC  portal:
https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/files/a9a42650-4613-448d-895e-4f904285f508

In the GDC data, we predict site and histology.

Description of the files/directories:  

-features_full: contains the text derivates from the GDC data. The conversion from pdf->txt took place using an optical character recognation program (e.g., tesseract:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/).

-histo_metadata.csv contains annotations extracted from GDC downloads by matching of the keys between the extracted metadata and the pathology reports.

-mapper: Dictionaries to map site and histology to an integer set.

-split: Split of the orignial report to training/validation/test sets.

-npy: contains the dataframes that would generated by the data handler script. 

-word2id.pkl: Dictionary mapping every word in the corpus to a specific index 

-vocab.npy: A numpy array of size #of_words * embedding_size(300) which mapps every word index to a corresponding ebedded vector using the word embedding model that has been trained by the data handler script

We do not make any representations or guarantees about the data. It is provided purely as a starter set to facilitate and end to end training of a model developed, but the accuracy and results of that model are not to be strongly considered.
